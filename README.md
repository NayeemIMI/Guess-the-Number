# Guess-the-Number
This is a simple number guessing game that is created by using JavaScript. The code is fully refractored!

# Technology Used:
- JavaScript

- HTML

- CSS

# Features:
- Here user can insert (guess) a number and check if the hidden number is equal to the inputted number.
- If the inserted number is higher/lower than the hidden number then "guess is higher/guess is lower" message will be shown!
- Finally I have implemented some validation in the input field and if the user insert's something invalid it will show a warning message.
